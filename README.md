LightAgent is a mobile agentic framework designed for efficient smartphone task execution. It features lightweight 3B-scale Vision-Language Models that can run directly on devices. The system combines these compact models with a dynamic device-cloud collaboration approach to optimize both performance and resource usage.

The framework uses a two-stage training methodology combining SFT and GRPO reinforcement learning with synthetic data generation. This approach enables the 3B models to achieve performance comparable to much larger 7B-9B models. Through intelligent task orchestration and structured memory mechanisms, LightAgent reduces cloud dependency by approximately 10% while maintaining robust performance across over 25 mobile applications in real-world scenarios.

## 🚀 Quick Start
This project comprises three core components designed for comprehensive mobile agent development and evaluation:

- ⚡ For **model training**, please refer to the training guide [README](./model_training/README.md) for comprehensive setup and execution instructions.
- 🔧 For the **data generation pipeline**, please refer to the data preparation guide [README](./prepare_data/README.md) for detailed implementation steps.

Below, we focus on evaluation using the AndroidLab benchmark framework.

### 📱 AndroidLab Benchmark Setup
Installation: Follow the official AndroidLab documentation [AndroidLab](https://github.com/THUDM/Android-Lab) for complete setup instructions.<br>

**Environment Configuration**:
- Recommended Mode: AVD on Mac (arm64) - validated in our experiments.<br>
- App Setup: Manual installation and task-specific configuration required.<br>
- Compatibility Note: Original Docker images are not compatible with AVD environments.<br>

### 🚀 Model Deployment & Inference
**vLLM Integration**:
- Inference scripts available in ./vllm_script/ directory<br>
- Optimized for efficient small model serving<br>

**Model Access**:
- LightAgent Weights: 3B parameter model hosted on HuggingFace<br>
- Deployment Process: Download weights → Deploy via vLLM → Configure inference service<br>
- Service Ready: Seamless integration with evaluation pipeline<br>

### ⚙️ Pre-Testing Configuration
- API Setup Required: Configure cloud model credentials in ./evaluation/evaluation.py: Line 63, Line 75, Line 81<br>
- Coming Soon: Streamlined configuration interface in development<br>

---

### 🧪 Testing & Evaluation

## Single Task Testing
Test individual tasks using the following command structure:

```bash
python eval.py -n test_name -c your path to config.yaml --task_id task_id
```

Example Usage:

```bash
python eval.py -n all_cloud_v1_hyper -c ./configs/example_xml_cloud_hyper.yaml --task_id zoom_1
```

## Batch Evaluation Scripts
Convenient batch testing scripts are available in `./test_script`:

• `all_test_cloud_v1_hyper.sh`: Evaluates all 138 AndroidLab benchmark tasks<br>
• `all_test_cloud_v1_hyper_add.sh`: Evaluates tasks for four additional mobile apps<br>

## Additional App Documentation
For comprehensive details about the four additional app tasks, refer to the documentation: ./docs/new_apps.md

### 📊 Result Generation

### LLM Evaluator Setup
Required Configuration: Set up LLM service credentials in ./evaluation/tasks/llm_evaluator.py:

• Line 10: API configuration<br>
• Line 12: Service URL<br>

💡 Enhancement: Our implementation replaces AndroidLab's rule-based evaluation with LLM-powered assessment, providing more nuanced and accurate task completion evaluation.

### Generate Evaluation Results
Execute result generation with the following command:

```bash
python generate_result.py --input_folder ./logs/evaluation/ --output_folder ./logs/evaluation/ --output_excel ./logs/evaluation/test_name.xlsx
```
### Batch Testing File Management
⚠️ Important: When using batch scripts from ./test_script/:<br>
• Manual Transfer Required: Move generated evaluation files from script directory to ./logs/<br>
• Then Execute: Run the result generation command above<br>
• Error Prevention: This step prevents file path conflicts and ensures proper result compilation<br>

## 🎯 Evaluation Results

The key findings from our online evaluation on AndroidLab are summarized as follows:

- LightAgent, when deployed in a device-cloud collaborative setting, incurs only a relatively small performance drop while effectively reducing the number of cloud model invocations.
- Notably, prompting large models for extended reasoning does not always yield better results—this benefit depends on the capability of the cloud model, and only sufficiently strong models can take advantage of such strategies.
- We also report a comparison between LightAgent-3B and both similar-sized and larger models (such as 9B models), showing that LightAgent-3B achieves performance close to that of 9B models, making it a true "small powerhouse."
- Furthermore, when compared with closed-source models, LightAgent-3B's performance is comparable to previous or lightweight versions of these proprietary models.

</p>

For each MLLM, we measure the average total steps required to complete tasks, the proportion of steps handled by the on-device model versus the cloud model, and the average steps when using only the cloud model to quantify the reduction in cloud calls. The main results are as follows:

- The cloud model is still responsible for about 65% of the steps, mainly due to the limited capacity of the smaller on-device model.
- Introducing the on-device model leads to approximately a 10% reduction in cloud calls.
- Stronger cloud models (such as GLM-4.5V) experience a smaller reduction in cloud calls, as they are capable of solving more tasks independently without relying on the on-device model.

</p>

We evaluate the average inference time per step using vLLM under different GPU setups. GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking could not run on a single 3090 GPU due to context length limits, so only two-GPU results are shown.

LightAgent, thanks to its lightweight architecture, demonstrates a clear advantage in inference speed, making it more suitable for real-world on-device scenarios. This advantage becomes even more pronounced as computational resources become constrained. In contrast, although GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking achieves higher performance, its inference time on two 3090s is 3.5 times that of LightAgent on a single 3090, and 4 times that of LightAgent on two 3090s. Its inability to run on a single 3090 further limits its feasibility for on-device deployment.
